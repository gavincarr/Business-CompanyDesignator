=head1 NAME

Business::CompanyDesignator - module for matching and stripping/manipulating the
company designators appended to company names

=head1 VERSION

Version: 0.11.

This module is considered a B<BETA> release. Interfaces may change and/or break
without notice until the module reaches version 1.0.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Business::CompanyDesignator is a perl module for matching and stripping/manipulating
the typical company designators appended (or sometimes, prepended) to company names.
It supports both long forms (e.g. Corporation, Incorporated, Limited etc.) and
abbreviations (e.g. Corp., Inc., Ltd., GmbH etc).

  use Business::CompanyDesignator;

  # Constructor
  $bcd = Business::CompanyDesignator->new;
  # Optionally, you can provide your own company_designator.yml file, instead of the bundled one
  $bcd = Business::CompanyDesignator->new(datafile => '/path/to/company_designator.yml');

  # Get lists of designators, which may be long (e.g. Limited) or abbreviations (e.g. Ltd.)
  @des = $bcd->designators;
  @long = $bcd->long_designators;
  @abbrev = $bcd->abbreviations;

  # Lookup individual designator records (returns B::CD::Record objects)
  # Lookup record by long designator (unique)
  $record = $bcd->record($long_designator);
  # Lookup records by abbreviation or long designator (may not be unique)
  @records = $bcd->records($designator);

  # Get a regex for matching designators by type ('end'/'begin') and lang
  # By default, returns 'end' regexes for all languages
  $re = $bcd->regex;
  $company_name =~ $re and say 'designator found!';
  $company_name =~ /$re\s*$/ and say 'final designator found!';
  my $re_begin_en = $bcd->regex('begin', 'en');

  # Split $company_name on designator, returning a ($before, $designator, $after) triplet,
  # plus the normalised form of the designator matched (can pass to records(), for example)
  ($before, $des, $after, $normalised_des) = $bcd->split_designator($company_name);

  # Or in scalar context, return a L<Business::CompanyDesignator::SplitResult> object
  $res = $bcd->split_designator($company_name, lang => 'en');
  print join ' / ', $res->designator_std, $res->short_name, $res->extra;


=head1 DATASET

Business::CompanyDesignator uses the company designator dataset from here:

  L<https://github.com/ProfoundNetworks/company_designator>

which is bundled with the module. You can use your own (updated or custom)
version, if you prefer, by passing a 'datafile' parameter to the constructor.

The dataset defines multiple long form designators (like "Company", "Limited",
or "IncorporÃ©e"), each of which have zero or more abbreviations (e.g. 'Co.',
'Ltd.', 'Inc.' etc.), and one or more language codes. The 'Company' entry,
for instance, looks like this:

  Company:
    abbr:
      - Co.
      - '& Co.'
      - and Co.
    lang: en

Long designators are unique across the dataset, but abbreviations are not
e.g. 'Inc.' is used for both "Incorporated" and French "IncorporÃ©e".

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new()

Creates a Business::CompanyDesignator object.

  $bcd = Business::CompanyDesignator->new;

By default this uses the bundled company_designator dataset. You may
provide your own (updated or custom) version by passing via a 'datafile'
parameter to the constructor.

  $bcd = Business::CompanyDesignator->new(datafile => '/path/to/company_designator.yml');

=head2 designators()

Returns the full list of company designator strings from the dataset
(both long form and abbreviations).

  @designators = $bcd->designators;

=head2 long_designators()

Returns the full list of long form designators from the dataset.

  @long = $bcd->long_designators;

=head2 abbreviations()

Returns the full list of abbreviation designators from the dataset.

  @abbrev = $bcd->abbreviations;

=head2 record($long_designator)

Returns the Business::CompanyDesignator::Record object for the given
long designator (and dies if not found).

=head2 records($designator)

Returns a list of Business::CompanyDesignator::Record objects for the
given abbreviation or long designator (for long designators there will
only be a single record returned, but abbreviations may map to multiple
records).

Use this method for abbreviations, or if you're aren't sure of a
designator's type.

=head2 regex([$type], [$lang])

Returns a regex for all matching designators for $type ('begin'/'end') and
$lang (iso 639-1 language code e.g. 'en', 'es', de', etc.) from the dataset.
$lang may be either a single language code scalar, or an arrayref of language
codes, for multiple alternative languages. The returned regex is case-insensitive
and non-anchored.

$type defaults to 'end', so without parameters regex() returns a regex
matching all designators for all languages.

=head2 split_designator($company_name, [lang => $lang], [allow_embedded => $bool])

Attempts to split $company_name on (the first) company designator found.

In array context split_designator returns a list of four items - a triplet of
strings from $company_name ( $before, $designator, $after ), plus the
standardised version of the designator as a fourth element.

  ($short_name, $des, $after_text, $des_std) = $bcd->split_designator($company_name);

In scalar context split_designator returns a L<Business::CompanyDesignator::SplitResult>
object.

  $res = $bcd->split_designator($company_name, lang => $lang);

The $des designator in array context, and the SplitResult $res->designator
is the designator text as it matched in $company_name, while the array context
$des_std, and the SplitResult $res->designator_std is the standardised version
as found in the dataset.

For instance, "ABC Pty Ltd" would return "Pty Ltd" as the $designator, but
"Pty. Ltd." as the stardardised form, and the latter would be what you
would find in designators() or would lookup with records(). Similarly,
"Accessoires XYZ Ltee" (without the french acute) would match, returning
"Ltee" (as found) for the $designator, but "LtÃ©e" (with the acute) as the
standardised form.

split_designator accepts the following optional (named) parameters:

=over 4

=item lang => $lang

$lang can be a scalar ISO 639-1 language code ('en', 'fr', 'cn', etc.), or an
arrayref containing multiple language codes. If $lang is defined, split_designator
will only match designators for the specified set of languages, which can improve
the accuracy of the split by reducing false positive matches.

=item allow_embedded => $boolean

allow_embedded is a boolean indicating whether or not designators can occur in
the middle of strings, instead of only at the beginning or end. Defaults to true,
for backwards compatibility, which yields more matches, but also more false
positives. Setting to false is safer, but yields fewer matches (and embedded
designators do occur surprisingly often in the wild.)

For more discussion, see L<AMBIGUITIES> below.

=back

=head2 AMBIGUITIES

Note that split_designator does not always get the split right. It checks for
final designators first, then leading ones, and then finally looks for embedded
designators (if allow_embedded is set to true).

Leading and trailing designators are usually reasonably accurate, but embedded
designators are problematic. For instance, embedded designators allow names like
these to split correctly:

    Amerihealth Insurance Company of NJ
    Trenkwalder Personal AG Schweiz
    Vicente Campano S L (COMERCIAL VICAM)
    Gvozdika, gostinitsa OOO ""Eko-Treyd""

but it will also wrongly split names like the following:

    XYZ PC Repairs ('PC' is a designator meaning 'Professional Corporation')
    Dr S L Ledingham ('S L' is a Spanish designator for 'Sociedad Limitada')

If you do want to allow splitting on embedded designators, you might want to pass
a 'lang' parameter to split_designator if you know the language(s) used for your
company names, as this will reduce the number of false positives by restricting the
set of designators matched against. It won't eliminate the issue altogether though,
so some post-processing might be required. (And I'd love to hear of ideas on how
to improve this.)
